# Linux Gaming

## General

> Note: If you have Bottles or Lutris, you dont really need other tools, other than specific software like Steam. Unless you have a specific need. I personally prefer Bottles. Bottles contain many of the tools mentioned below integrated and more.

PopOS is a good OS for gaming, but not only. <https://pop.system76.com/>

XanMod kernel, usually has the latest features and patches and are up-to-date, and also there is a realtime(rt) version that will help with latency on gaming. <https://xanmod.org/>
