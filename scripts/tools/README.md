> If you dont trust the stored files from this folder, you can download them yourself directly from the place where it was downloaded from.

- Device Cleanup CMD - <https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/device_cleanup_cmd>

- Nvidia Profile Inspector - <https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector/releases>

- NanaRun (MinSudo) - <https://github.com/M2Team/NanaRun/releases> - It's the alternative recommendation and from the same team as the now archived NSudo - <https://github.com/M2TeamArchived/NSudo>

- KX Utility - <https://github.com/Faintsnow/HE/issues/5#issuecomment-1172197067>

- Nvidia Control Panel - It's here if someone are unable to install from the driver into their system, not an actual helper tool.
  - If `nvcplui.exe` get a block message, it means you might have a ownership problem. I added a file inside called `ownership_fix.ps1` that should help with the problem.
